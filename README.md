This task was a more striaght forward web design project that didn't require as much brain power as the tic-tac-toe project, but nonetheless it gave me a decent challange and I had more fun with it than anticipated. The catch with this project is everything has to be designed with javascript, except for the css file of course (unless I wanted to be a true masochist). This project is also glued together using webpack, which was an interesting experience that seemed massively overengineered at first, but it honestly didn't give me any troubles.

All in all, I want to use html again after this one!
